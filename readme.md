# Go Virtuo Test project
## This project is still under development... I had never used MongoDB before so my use of it will surely not be perfect. I you allow me to keep developing this little project I'll implement missing routes and optimize my implementation of MongoDB lib.
This project has been developed by Gabriel Hubert.

To install dependencies, please use the command "npm install" at the root of the repository.

To launch the server, please use the command **"node server.js"**.

The server will be running on **"http://localhost:3000"**.

The two possible routes are **".../cars"** and **".../stations"**.

You can access a specified car or station by adding it's id like this : **".../cars/[the id of the car]"**.
